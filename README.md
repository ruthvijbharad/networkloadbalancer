# Network Load Balancer (Round Robin)

A Python-based network load balancer that distributes client requests across multiple backend servers using the Round Robin algorithm.  
It includes a live dashboard to visualize request distribution and server activity in real time.

---

## Features

- Implements Round Robin load balancing logic.
- Supports multiple backend servers.
- Handles real tasks like:
  - Arithmetic operations (`SUM`, `FACT`, `FIB`, `PRIME`)
  - Text manipulation (`ECHO`, `UPPER`, `REVERSE`)
  - Artificial delay simulation (`SLEEP`)
- Live dashboard using Python’s built-in HTTP server (no external libraries).
- Clients can:
  - Send automated workloads (`client_work.py`)
  - Send manual or interactive requests (`client_interactive.py`)
